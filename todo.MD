Description: Your task is to process a sequence of integer numbers to determine the following statistics: Without using system Math library functions, process a sequence of integers to determine the following statistics:

For example: [2, 4, 21, -8, 53, 40]

minimum value = -8, maximum value = 53, number of elements in the sequence = 6, average value = 18.666666666667

end.
